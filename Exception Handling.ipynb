    "# Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique helps in handling any exceptions that the program may raise during its execution. The syntax for this is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        try block code\n",
    "        ....\n",
    "        ....\n",
    "    except Exception:\n",
    "        except block code\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        finally block code\n",
    "        \n",
    " - The main code goes into the ***try*** block which we assume is going to cause the exception. If an exception is raised, the code within the ***except*** block gets executed. The code in ***finally*** block executes no matter the exception is raised or not. This is usually used when a file is opened in the try block and we need to close it before the execution. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " - The program execution of try block will terminate at the line which caused the error. The following lines of code in the try block will not be executed.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Instead of ***except Exception*** (this is generic exception), the name of the exception can be mentioned. Like ***except ValueError*** (this is case specific excpetion). The word Exception is a high-level term and can handle any kind of exception. However, exceptions like ValueError only handles particular exception. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - There can be as many as ***except*** blocks based on the variety of exceptions you think will be raised. However, there can only be one generic exception block\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Multiple specific exceptions can be handled in a single except block. \n",
    "         \n",
    "         syntax - except (valueError, ZeroDivisionError):\n",
    "                             except block code..."
